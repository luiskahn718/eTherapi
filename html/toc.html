            <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on July 4, 2014.</p>
            <p>eQuanimity, Inc. (&ldquo;eQuanimity,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo; &ldquo;www.etherapi.com&rdquo;) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. &nbsp;This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by eQuanimity when you use the eQuanimity Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our User Agreement or Provider Agreement. </p>
            <p>Information We Collect</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li> 
                    <h3>User-Provided Information</h3>
                    <p>You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, if you register for a User or Provider Account with the Service. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service. You may provide us information in User Content you post to the Service.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Client Information</h4>
                            <p>Upon registration, you may provide us with information about yourself and your health plan (for example, health plan, health plan subscriber ID number, email, home phone number, and home address). We encourage you to provide this information in order to enable optimal use of the Service. The registration process requires you to choose a unique identifier (for example, username and password) for your account. To protect your privacy, eQuanimity allows you to choose a username that does not correspond to your real name. </p>
                            <p>eQuanimity offers various messaging platforms relating to specific requests and/or purposes to facilitate communications between Clients and Providers. Either you or your Provider may initiate such messages and/or communications. &nbsp;Your response and/or provision of information regarding these communications is voluntary; therefore, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Certain communications (for example, e-mails, messages) are recorded and maintained by eQuanimity. eQuanimity will not edit the content of the communication between you and your Provider.</p>
                            <p>eQuanimity considers these communications to be personal and private and will not use or disclose these communications in personally identifiable form except as provided for in this Privacy Policy or where required by law or unless you agree to additional use and disclosure of information provided via the Service. However, eQuanimity may block or remove certain communications materials (for example, offensive or otherwise unacceptable materials for which a complaint has been reported).</p>
                            <p>From time to time, your Provider or a member of your Provider's staff may provide eQuanimity with medical or other information contained in their medical records or patient files. This may include sharing of information about you via integration between our Service and certain systems used by your Provider containing information about you (for example, medical record-keeping/storage systems, billing systems). The provision and sharing of this information is optional by your Provider and based upon your consent. &nbsp;In addition, eQuanimity may share information provided by you in our Service to update and supplement your medical or other information with your Provider or contained in your Provider's systems.</p>
                            <p>Your Provider will have access to your personal information, including your first and last name, during each Visit. Once you initiate a Visit, you may be asked to provide additional health information specific to the treatment you require. Participation in a Visit is voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. &nbsp;Visits may be recorded and stored by the Service.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Provider Information</h4>
                            <p>When a Provider registers at eQuanimity, we require the collection of certain contact information as part of the Provider registration process (for example, name, medical license number and state of issue, primary specialty, office address, office zip code). It is optional for you to provide additional contact information (for example, office fax, e-mail address date of birth, and specialties), but you are encouraged to provide this information in order to enable optimal use of our Service. When you register at eQuanimity, the registration process requires you to choose a unique identifier (for example, username and password) for your account.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Cookies Information</h3>
                    <p>When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets eQuanimity help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser&rsquo;s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Log File Information</h3>
                    <p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Clear Gifs Information</h3>
                    <p>When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your eQuanimity account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make eQuanimity better for our users.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. For example, we may use the Provider information that you supply to us in order to verify your credentials, such as your medical license. We may use Client information in reference to communications with Payors or our credit card processing partners. </p>
            <p>By providing eQuanimity your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your account. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
            <p>Following termination or deactivation of your Client or Provider Account, eQuanimity may retain your information for a reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes, including without limitation as required by law. Furthermore, eQuanimity may continue to make available indefinitely all User Content posted to public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your Member account.</p>
            <p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email invitation. eQuanimity stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database at privacy@eqlive.org.</p>
            <p>eQuanimity may use certain information about you and/or your User Content internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content. </p>
            <p>eQuanimity reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the Service. We reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. eQuanimity also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>
            <p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
            
            <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>
                    <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                    <p>eQuanimity will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. &nbsp;eQuanimity may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you, such as billing a Client health plan or charging your credit card. If we do this, such third parties&rsquo; use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of eQuanimity (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Client Information</h3>
                    <p>We may share Client information, such as your username, email, and home state, with your Providers. &nbsp;Any Visit content will be shared with your Provider and we may retain a copy of such content. &nbsp;When your Provider elects to charge for a Visit and a Payor has an agreement with eQuanimity to cover your Visit, we may release your contact information, the date of the service, the service descriptor, and the service charge to the Payor for payment purposes. If you initiate a payment transaction on the Service, we transmit your credit card information to our payment processing partner via encrypted transmission. &nbsp;eQuanimity may cross check your payment information with the information that you provided at registration for verification purposes. If your Provider determines that it is clinically appropriate, he or she may send a referral message to another provider. This referral message may contain personally identifiable health information about you. Although the consulting provider may be able to view this information, he or she cannot update or edit your information. We will obtain your consent before sharing any of your personal health records with personally identifiable information. However, if you ask us to transfer or forward your personal health records, that request shall constitute consent.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Provider Information</h3>
                    <p>eQuanimity may use Provider information (for example, name, license number, etc) to submit claims to health plans and Payors that pay for services you provide via eQuanimity to your Clients. We will also make your information publicly available via your Provider profile or Provider search functionality so that potential Clients can find you on the Service. eQuanimity may disclose your information as required by law or reporting obligations, for example to licensing entities. eQuanimity may also disclose your information to verify any credentials you supply.</p>
                    <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. </p>
                    <p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. To change your privacy settings on the Service, you may go to your setting page to do so. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. </p>
                    <p>From time to time, we may run special offers or other events or activities (&ldquo;Events&rdquo;) on the Service together with a third party partner. &nbsp;If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties&rsquo; use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p>
                    <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, eQuanimity will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of eQuanimity, our Users or others.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                    <p>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, anonymous data taken from health information and combined with other anonymous data to create aggregate data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain eQuanimity services.</p>
                    <p>eQuanimity may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on eQuanimity. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. eQuanimity does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks eQuanimity to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. The eQuanimity Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
            <p>eQuanimity uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and implement your privacy settings. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to eQuanimity or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. </p>
            <p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from eQuanimity, at all times.</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                <li>
                    <h3>Compromise of Personal Information</h3>
                    <p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, eQuanimity will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2>
            <p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case eQuanimity may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account and changing the settings. You can review and correct the information about you that eQuanimity keeps on file by contacting us directly at support@etherapi.com. You may deactivate a Provider by selecting the Provider deactivation option if you no longer wish to allow him or her to view your information. The Provider will be able to view a static version of your information as of the deactivation, but will no longer be able to view updates.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, eQuanimity does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as Members. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on eQuanimity. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@etherapi.com.</p>

            <h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
            <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. &nbsp;Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>

            <h2>Notification Procedures</h2>
            <p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by eQuanimity in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. &nbsp;Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. </p>
